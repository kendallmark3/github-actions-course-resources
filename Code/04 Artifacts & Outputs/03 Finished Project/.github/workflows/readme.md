# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. You can build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub, or integrate with a variety of third-party services.

This `README.md` will guide you through the basics of GitHub Actions, providing a foundation for creating your own automated workflows.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions enable you to define custom workflows that automatically execute a series of commands when specific events occur in your GitHub repository. These events can range from a `push` to a branch, a `pull_request` being opened, a `release` being published, or even a scheduled `cron` job.

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is crucial for effectively using GitHub Actions:

### Workflows

A workflow is an automated, configurable process that runs one or more jobs. Workflows are defined in YAML files (`.yml` or `.yaml`) within the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository.

### Events

An event is a specific activity in your repository that triggers a workflow run. Common events include:

* `push`: When code is pushed to a branch.
* `pull_request`: When a pull request is opened, synchronized, or closed.
* `workflow_dispatch`: Manually trigger a workflow from the GitHub UI or API.
* `schedule`: Run a workflow at a scheduled time using `cron` syntax.

### Jobs

A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Each job runs in a fresh instance of the virtual environment. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially, and dependencies between jobs can be defined.

### Steps

A step is an individual task within a job. Steps can be a script (a set of commands) or an action (a reusable unit of code). Steps are executed in the order they are defined.

### Actions

Actions are the fundamental building blocks of a workflow. They are reusable units of code that can perform complex tasks without you having to write a lot of code. Actions can be:

* **Community-created:** Available on the GitHub Marketplace.
* **Locally-defined:** Custom actions you create within your repository.
* **Docker container actions:** Actions packaged as Docker containers.

### Runners

A runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. It listens for available jobs, runs them, and reports the progress and results back to GitHub. GitHub provides Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS virtual machines as hosted runners, or you can host your own self-hosted runners.

## Getting Started: Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow that triggers on a `push` and prints "Hello, GitHub Actions!" to the console.

### Workflow File Location

All workflow files must be placed in the `.github/workflows/` directory at the root of your repository.

### Basic Workflow Structure

1.  **Create the directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    ```

2.  **Create a new file:** `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml`

3.  **Add the following content:**

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/hello-world.yml
    name: Hello World Workflow

    on: [push] # This workflow runs on every push to any branch

    jobs:
      build: # This is the ID of our job
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specify the runner environment

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4 # An action to check out your repository's code

          - name: Greet
            run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!" # A simple script step
    ```

4.  **Commit and Push:**
    ```bash
    git add .github/workflows/hello-world.yml
    git commit -m "Add hello world workflow"
    git push
    ```

Now, navigate to your repository on GitHub, click on the "Actions" tab, and you should see your "Hello World Workflow" running!

## Common Commands and Tips

While there aren't "commands" in the traditional sense for GitHub Actions (they are defined in YAML), here are some tips for managing and interacting with your workflows:

### Viewing Workflow Runs

* Go to your repository on GitHub.
* Click on the **"Actions"** tab.
* You'll see a list of all workflow runs. Click on a specific run to view its details, including jobs, steps, and logs.

### Debugging Workflows

* **Review Logs:** The most crucial debugging tool. The logs for each step will show you exactly what happened during execution. Look for error messages.
* **Increase Verbosity:** For JavaScript actions, you can set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` to enable step debugging logs.
* **Local Testing (act):** For more complex scenarios, consider using tools like `act` (https://github.com/nektos/act) to run your workflows locally before pushing to GitHub.
* **`continue-on-error`:** You can add `continue-on-error: true` to a step to allow a job to continue even if that step fails. This is useful for debugging.

### Skipping Workflow Runs

You can conditionally skip workflow runs or individual jobs using `if` conditions in your workflow file.

Example: Only run on `main` branch pushes:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ...
Example: Skip a job if a specific file hasn't changed:

YAML

jobs:
  my-job:
    if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified, 'my-specific-file.js')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ...
Secrets
Sensitive information (like API keys, tokens, or passwords) should never be hardcoded in your workflow files. GitHub Actions provides a secure way to store and access secrets:

Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click on "Settings".

In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".

Click "New repository secret".

Give your secret a Name (e.g., MY_API_KEY) and its Value.

You can then access this secret in your workflow using the secrets context:

YAML

steps:
  - name: Use a secret
    run: echo "The API Key is: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}"
Sample Workflow: React App CI/CD
This sample workflow demonstrates a common CI/CD pipeline for a React application. It will:

Trigger on push to the main branch.
Install dependencies.
Run tests.
Build the React application.
(Optional) Deploy to GitHub Pages (requires additional setup for your package.json and a gh-pages branch).
Prerequisites
A React project (created with Create React App, Vite, etc.).
Ensure your package.json has test and build scripts defined.
If deploying to GitHub Pages, ensure your package.json has a homepage field pointing to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., "homepage": "https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>") and the gh-pages package installed (npm install gh-pages --save-dev).
Workflow Explained
Create a new file: .github/workflows/react-ci-cd.yml

YAML

# .github/workflows/react-ci-cd.yml
name: React CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    name: Build and Test React App
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checkout the repository code

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify the Node.js version to use

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install # Install project dependencies

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test -- --watchAll=false # Run tests, disabling watch mode for CI

      - name: Build React App
        run: npm run build # Build the production-ready React app

      - name: Upload Build Artifact (Optional)
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: react-build
          path: build/ # Path to your built React app (usually 'build' or 'dist')

  # deploy-to-github-pages: # Uncomment this job to enable GitHub Pages deployment
  #   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  #   needs: build-and-test # This job depends on the 'build-and-test' job succeeding
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   if: success() # Only run if the previous job was successful
  #
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Checkout Repository
  #       uses: actions/checkout@v4
  #
  #     - name: Download Build Artifact
  #       uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  #       with:
  #         name: react-build
  #         path: build/ # Download the build artifact to this path
  #
  #     - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  #       uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4 # Action for deploying to gh-pages
  #       with:
  #         github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided
  #         publish_dir: ./build # Directory to publish
  #         force_orphan: true # Recommended for clean deployments
  #         cname: your-custom-domain.com # Uncomment and replace if you have a custom domain
To use the deploy-to-github-pages job:

Uncomment the deploy-to-github-pages job in the .github/workflows/react-ci-cd.yml file.
Configure homepage in package.json:
JSON

// package.json
{
  // ...
  "homepage": "https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>",
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
Replace <USERNAME> and <REPOSITORY_NAME> with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
Install gh-pages: npm install gh-pages --save-dev
Ensure your repository has GitHub Pages enabled in its settings, pointing to the gh-pages branch.
